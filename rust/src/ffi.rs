/// There is no way to obtain a mutable reference from such pointer.

///
/// ## Safety and validity guarantees
/// Apart from trivial constructors such as [`BridgedPtr::null()`] and [`BridgedPtr::null_mut()`], there
/// is only one way to construct a [`BridgedPtr`] instance - from raw pointer via [`BridgedPtr::from_raw()`].
/// This constructor is `unsafe`. It is user's responsibility to ensure that the raw pointer
/// provided to the constructor is **valid**. In other words, the pointer comes from some valid
/// allocation, or from some valid reference.
///
/// ## Generic lifetime and aliasing guarantees
/// We distinguish two types of pointers: shared ([`Shared`]) and exclusive ([`Exclusive`]).
/// Shared pointers can be converted to immutable (&) references, while exclusive pointers
/// can be converted to either immutable (&) or mutable (&mut) reference. User needs to pick
/// the correct mutability property of the pointer during construction. This is yet another
/// reason why [`BridgedPtr::from_raw`] is `unsafe`.
///
/// Pointer is parameterized by the lifetime. Thanks to that, we can tell whether the pointer
/// **owns** or **borrows** the pointee. Once again, user is responsible for "picking"
/// the correct lifetime when creating the pointer. For example, when raw pointer
/// comes from [`Box::into_raw()`], user could create a [`BridgedPtr<'static, T, (Exclusive,)>`].
/// `'static` lifetime represents that user is the exclusive **owner** of the pointee, and
/// is responsible for freeing the memory (e.g. via [`Box::from_raw()`]).
/// On the other hand, when pointer is created from some immutable reference `&'a T`,
/// the correct choice of BridgedPtr would be [`BridgedPtr<'a, T, (Shared,)>`]. It means that
/// holder of the created pointer **borrows** the pointee (with some lifetime `'a`
/// inherited from the immutable borrow `&'a T`).
///
/// Both [`BridgedPtr::into_ref()`] and [`BridgedPtr::into_mut_ref()`] consume the pointer.
/// At first glance, it seems impossible to obtain multiple immutable reference from one pointer.
/// This is why pointer reborrowing mechanism is introduced. There are two methods: [`BridgedPtr::borrow()`]
/// and [`BridgedPtr::borrow_mut()`]. Both of them cooperate with borrow checker and enforce
/// aliasing XOR mutability principle at compile time.
///
/// ## Safe conversions to referential types
/// Thanks to the above guarantees, conversions to referential types are **safe**.
/// See methods [`BridgedPtr::into_ref()`] and [`BridgedPtr::into_mut_ref()`].
///
/// ## Memory layout
/// We use repr(transparent), so the struct has the same layout as underlying [`Option<NonNull<T>>`].
/// Thanks to <https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/#representation optimization>,
/// we are guaranteed, that for `T: Sized`, our struct has the same layout
